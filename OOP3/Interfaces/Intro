I N T E R F A C E S:
-will define contract/specification which will govern; how a program logic will behave.

Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how.
It is the blueprint of the behaviour.
Interface do not have constructor.
The interface cannot contain concrete(with implementation) methods


Why do we use an Interface?
To achieve total abstraction.
Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve multiple inheritances.
